🧠 AI ChatBot in Java
This is a simple AI chatbot implemented in Java that simulates intelligent conversation using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a learning mechanism. It starts with a small set of predefined responses and can learn new ones from the user during the conversation.

📋 How It Works
The chatbot loads a small set of known questions and answers.

The user interacts by typing a message.

If the message contains a known keyword, the bot responds.

If not, the bot asks the user for the correct response and "learns" it by saving it in memory.

Typing exit or bye ends the conversation.
